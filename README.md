# Johnny Five, SocketIO, Express
## A very simple browser switch for an arduino LED

In this project, 
I created a front-end (using HTML, CSS & JS) and back-end (using Express, SocketIO & Johnny Five) to have a simple web switch that switches an LED connected to an Arduino UNO to turn on and off. 

This is relatively straightforward if you understand the concept of web sockets and arduino which I didn't during this project.

This is meant to be a starter for anyone who seems to be interested in IOT and wants to get their hands dirty.
